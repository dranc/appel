# Call My Love in just 1 click

This project is a small project I've done during my studies. Even if it's was live, it was not update since 2017. Because Google have sent some notification to alert me that they will delete it because it was too old and not maintained, I have decided to try to re do it using Flutter in my sparetime.

You can download the app in [the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a2a.appel) or find the version you like in [the release section](https://github.com/dranc/appel/releases).

## Getting started

The project is only compatible with Android. The original idea come from VDApps that own the iOS version.

This is just a project so I can learn a little bit Flutter. I also tried to play with GitHub workflow here make everything autonomous.
